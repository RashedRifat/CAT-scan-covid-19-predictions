# Covid-19 Detection with Pruned CNN and TensorFlow Lite
Predicting the presecence of COVID-19 from CAT Scans. Completed as a part of NYU's Advanced Machine Learning Course.

This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of a sophisticated Covid-19 detection system using a Pruned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, optimized with TensorFlow Lite.

The primary focus of this project is to create a portable, efficient, and highly accurate model that can identify the presence of Covid-19 through image analysis. This project leverages the power of Pruned CNNs, which remove less important information from the network, making it lighter and more efficient while preserving its predictive power.

With the help of TensorFlow Lite, we convert this pruned model into a compact, lightweight format, suitable for use on mobile and edge devices. This facilitates real-time analysis and prediction, paving the way for rapid detection and potentially life-saving interventions.

Main features:

Utilization of Pruned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to maximize efficiency and accuracy.
Deployment on edge devices using TensorFlow Lite for real-time prediction.
Comprehensive training and testing datasets for robust model validation.
Easy-to-follow codebase, thoroughly documented for both beginners and advanced users.
Detailed performance metrics and visualization tools to understand the model's effectiveness.
Please note that while our aim is to provide a powerful tool to aid in the detection of Covid-19, it is not intended to replace professional medical advice or diagnosis. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical concerns.

This is an open-source project. We welcome contributions, ideas, and suggestions to improve the model's effectiveness and usability. Please refer to the 'Contribution' section to know more about how you can contribute.

Stay Safe, Stay Healthy.
